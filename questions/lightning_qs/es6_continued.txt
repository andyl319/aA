This essay will give you a quick introduction to ES6. If you don’t know
what is ES6, it’s a new JavaScript implementation. If you’re a busy JavaScript
software engineer (and who is not?), then proceed reading to learn the best 10
features of the new generation of the most popular programming language—JavaScript.

Here’s the list of the top 10 best ES6 features for a busy software engineer
(in no particular order):

Default Parameters in ES6
Template Literals in ES6
Multi-line Strings in ES6
Destructuring Assignment in ES6
Enhanced Object Literals in ES6
Arrow Functions in ES6
Promises in ES6
Block-Scoped Constructs Let and Const
Classes in ES6
Modules in ES6

Disclaimer: the list if highly biased and subjective. It is in no way was
intended to diminish usefulness of other ES6 features, which didn’t make it
to the list simply because I had to limit the number to 10.

First, a bit of history because those who don’t know the history can’t make
it. This is a brief JavaScript timeline:

1995: JavaScript is born as LiveScript
1997: ECMAScript standard is established
1999: ES3 comes out and IE5 is all the rage
2000–2005: XMLHttpRequest, a.k.a. AJAX, gains popularity in app such as
Outlook Web Access (2000) and Oddpost (2002), Gmail (2004) and Google Maps (2005).
2009: ES5 comes out (this is what most of us use now) with forEach,
Object.keys, Object.create (specially for Douglas Crockford), and standard JSON
2015: ES6/ECMAScript2015 comes out; it has mostly syntactic sugar,
because people weren’t able to agree on anything more ground breaking (ES7?)
Enough with history, let’s get to the business of coding.

1. Default Parameters in ES6

Remember we had to do these statements to define default parameters:

var link = function (height, color, url) {
    var height = height || 50
    var color = color || 'red'
    var url = url || 'http://azat.co'
    ...
}
They were okay until the value was 0 and because 0 is falsy in JavaScript
it would default to the hard-coded value instead of becoming the value
itself. Of course, who needs 0 as a value (#sarcasmfont), so we just ignored
this flaw and used the logic OR anyway… No more! In ES6, we can put the
default values right in the signature of the functions:

var link = function(height = 50, color = 'red', url = 'http://azat.co') {
  ...
}
By the way, this syntax is similar to Ruby!
