This essay will give you a quick introduction to ES6. If you don’t know
what is ES6, it’s a new JavaScript implementation. If you’re a busy JavaScript
software engineer (and who is not?), then proceed reading to learn the best 10
features of the new generation of the most popular programming language—JavaScript.

Here’s the list of the top 10 best ES6 features for a busy software engineer
(in no particular order):

Default Parameters in ES6
Template Literals in ES6
Multi-line Strings in ES6
Destructuring Assignment in ES6
Enhanced Object Literals in ES6
Arrow Functions in ES6
Promises in ES6
Block-Scoped Constructs Let and Const
Classes in ES6
Modules in ES6

Disclaimer: the list if highly biased and subjective. It is in no way was
intended to diminish usefulness of other ES6 features, which didn’t make it
to the list simply because I had to limit the number to 10.

First, a bit of history because those who don’t know the history can’t make
it. This is a brief JavaScript timeline:

1995: JavaScript is born as LiveScript
1997: ECMAScript standard is established
1999: ES3 comes out and IE5 is all the rage
2000–2005: XMLHttpRequest, a.k.a. AJAX, gains popularity in app such as
Outlook Web Access (2000) and Oddpost (2002), Gmail (2004) and Google Maps (2005).
2009: ES5 comes out (this is what most of us use now) with forEach,
Object.keys, Object.create (specially for Douglas Crockford), and standard JSON
2015: ES6/ECMAScript2015 comes out; it has mostly syntactic sugar,
because people weren’t able to agree on anything more ground breaking (ES7?)
Enough with history, let’s get to the business of coding.

1. Default Parameters in ES6

Remember we had to do these statements to define default parameters:

var link = function (height, color, url) {
    var height = height || 50
    var color = color || 'red'
    var url = url || 'http://azat.co'
    ...
}
They were okay until the value was 0 and because 0 is falsy in JavaScript
it would default to the hard-coded value instead of becoming the value
itself. Of course, who needs 0 as a value (#sarcasmfont), so we just ignored
this flaw and used the logic OR anyway… No more! In ES6, we can put the
default values right in the signature of the functions:

var link = function(height = 50, color = 'red', url = 'http://azat.co') {
  ...
}
By the way, this syntax is similar to Ruby!

2. Template Literals in ES6

Template literals or interpolation in other languages is a way to output
variables in the string. So in ES5 we had to break the string like this:

var name = 'Your name is ' + first + ' ' + last + '.'
var url = 'http://localhost:3000/api/messages/' + id
Luckily, in ES6 we can use a new syntax ${NAME} inside of the back-ticked string:

var name = `Your name is ${first} ${last}.`
var url = `http://localhost:3000/api/messages/${id}`

3. Multi-line Strings in ES6

Another yummy syntactic sugar is multi-line string. In ES5, we had to
use one of these approaches:

var roadPoem = 'Then took the other, as just as fair,\n\t'
    + 'And having perhaps the better claim\n\t'
    + 'Because it was grassy and wanted wear,\n\t'
    + 'Though as for that the passing there\n\t'
    + 'Had worn them really about the same,\n\t'

var fourAgreements = 'You have the right to be you.\n\
    You can only be you when you do your best.'
While in ES6, simply utilize the backticks:

var roadPoem = `Then took the other, as just as fair,
    And having perhaps the better claim
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
    Though as for that the passing there
    Had worn them really about the same,`

var fourAgreements = `You have the right to be you.
    You can only be you when you do your best.`


    4. Destructuring Assignment in ES6

Destructuring can be a harder concept to grasp, because there’s some
magic going on… let’s say you have simple assignments where keys house
and mouse are variables house and mouse:

var data = $('body').data(), // data has properties house and mouse
  house = data.house,
  mouse = data.mouse
Other examples of destructuring assignments (from Node.js):

var jsonMiddleware = require('body-parser').json

var body = req.body, // body has username and password
  username = body.username,
  password = body.password
In ES6, we can replace the ES5 code above with these statements:

var {house, mouse} = $('body').data() // we'll get house and mouse variables

var {json: jsonMiddleware} = require('body-parser')

var {username, password} = req.body
This also works with arrays. Crazy!

var [col1, col2]  = $('.column'),
  [line1, line2, line3, , line5] = file.split('\n')
It might take some time to get use to the destructuring assignment syntax,
but it’s a sweet sugarcoating.


5. Enhanced Object Literals in ES6

What you can do with object literals now is mind blowing! We went from a
glorified version of JSON in ES5 to something closely resembling classes in ES6.

Here’s a typical ES5 object literal with some methods and attributes/properties:

var serviceBase = {port: 3000, url: 'azat.co'},
    getAccounts = function(){return [1,2,3]}

var accountServiceES5 = {
  port: serviceBase.port,
  url: serviceBase.url,
  getAccounts: getAccounts,
  toString: function() {
    return JSON.stringify(this.valueOf())
  },
  getUrl: function() {return "http://" + this.url + ':' + this.port},
  valueOf_1_2_3: getAccounts()
}
If we want to be fancy, we can inherit from serviceBase by making it the
prototype with the Object.create method:

var accountServiceES5ObjectCreate = Object.create(serviceBase)
var accountServiceES5ObjectCreate = {
  getAccounts: getAccounts,
  toString: function() {
    return JSON.stringify(this.valueOf())
  },
  getUrl: function() {return "http://" + this.url + ':' + this.port},
  valueOf_1_2_3: getAccounts()
}
I know, accountServiceES5ObjectCreate and accountServiceES5 are NOT
totally identical, because one object (accountServiceES5) will have the
properties in the __proto__ object as shown below:

But for the sake of the example, we’ll consider them similar. So in ES6
object literal, there are shorthands for assignment getAccounts: getAccounts,
becomes just getAccounts,. Also, we set the prototype right there in the
__proto__`` property which makes sense (not‘proto’` though:

var serviceBase = {port: 3000, url: 'azat.co'},
    getAccounts = function(){return [1,2,3]}
var accountService = {
    __proto__: serviceBase,
    getAccounts,
Also, we can invoke super and have dynamic keys (valueOf_1_2_3):

    toString() {
     return JSON.stringify((super.valueOf()))
    },
    getUrl() {return "http://" + this.url + ':' + this.port},
    [ 'valueOf_' + getAccounts().join('_') ]: getAccounts()
};
console.log(accountService)

This is a great enhancement to good old object literals!
